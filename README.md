Alfred workflow to interact, and perform various functions with the service [Slack](http://slack.com/).

Currently available:
* Setting your API Token: 'slt' and paste your token. If you don't have one hold cmd to open the API page to get one
* Search files: 'slf' will let you search files. Selecting a file opens it in your browser
* Search users and rooms: 'slk' displays list of search user and room names. Hitting enter triggers an Applescript to interact with the **desktop** application and passes the selected name. Similar to cmd+k
* Set your presence: 'slp' with 'active' or 'away'
* View, leave and join channels: 'slc' displays a searchable list. Selecting a channel with 'alt' leaves and 'ctrl' lets you join.

To-do:
* Search direct messages
* Create a smoother API key/token process

This workflow was created with the help of [Dean Jackson's](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow) library.
